Big Data Analysis for Covid Detection

This project revolves around image classification using various types of lung X-ray images: those infected with viruses, those infected with Covid-19, and uninfected X-ray images. To begin with, we will employ the CLAHE method (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) to enhance the image contrast and brightness. Additionally, we will resize the images to ensure consistent image sizes throughout the dataset. Moving forward, we will develop an image classification model using the powerful CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) architecture, and DNN (Deep Neural Networks) leveraging the capabilities of the tensorflow.keras package.
Lastly, we will explore an alternative approach by implementing the CNN and DNN algorithm using NumPy, allowing us to compare its performance against the results obtained using popular deep learning packages such as Tensorflow and PyTorch.
